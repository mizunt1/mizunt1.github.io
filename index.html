<h2>About me</h2>


<p>I am a PhD student at Mila - Montreal Institute of learning algorithms, <br>  
under the supervision of Laurent Charlin. <br>
Previously, I was a masters student, then a RA at the OATML group at Oxford,<br>
supervised by Yarin Gal. <br>
Before that, I worked at Oxford Nanopore Technologies, using machine learning <br>
for Nanopore DNA sequencing. <br>
My bachelors was in Physics which I undertook at University College London. <br>

<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p>I am interested in causal structure learning, decision making under uncertainty <br>
and in general, how to we make the right decisions or collect the right kind of data <br> for the question we are posing to the algorithm.</p>
